								<h3>Summary</h3>
								<p>Zalando‘s department Brand Solutions cares for brand relations and enables them to manage their articles on Zalando and the incoming orders on their own.</p>
                <p>Constantly validating user-related assumptions and interface designs in a lean process, an MVP was designed and iterated, containing tested interaction flows and navigations to add articles into the Zalando shop and handle customer orders until their very deliveries.</p>
                <p>The whole product was designed as a responsive, web-based service, optimized to be easily used on smartphones, tablets and desktop computers.</p>

								<h3>Description</h3>
                
  							<h4>Client</h4>
								<p>Zalando is well-known to be the largest online fashion seller in Europe. Founded in 2008 as an online shoe retailer, the company quickly grew, until now offering fashion articles in 15 countries. Zalando’s latest endeavor is to change from a retailing website to a fashion platform that connects brands and customers.</p>
                <p>Brand Solutions is a newly founded department within Zalando, determined to develop and offer software to fashion brands, merchants and suppliers that enables them to act more independently on Zalando.</p>

						<div class="single-project-text">
							<div class="about-single-project">
								<h3>Problem</h3>
								<p>Products that are sold on Zalando have to be bought ahead and then re-sold with profit. This causes that fashion brands and merchants lack the controls of what is sold on Zalando and how the prices are. Especially, smaller brands and merchants with niche products cannot independently place their articles in the online shop. Furthermore suppliers are not able to change prices according to new situations and stocks.</p>

              <h4>Task</h4>
							<p>My task at Zalando Brand Solutions concerned a usual combination of designing and testing prototypes of an MVP. As the minimum feature set had already been predefined by the responsible product owner and managers, I mainly designed how brands and merchants could manage articles to be sold on Zalando, but also the process of handling and completing incoming customer orders.</p>
              <p>The features that should be implemented were to add new articles via entering an EAN which determined the product, its size and color. The user should then be able to specify stock and and price. Managing orders concerned checking the payment status and completing the order by sending out the article to the given address.</p>
              <p>Aside from caring for article and order management, I also worked on the overarching navigation, connecting the different services of the Brand Solutions product family. These features were a main menu to switch between a shop CMS, an analytics section and the article and order management, but also the registration of new user, managing different roles within a team of users and editing account data.</p>
              <p>All interface elements were to be used on smartphone, tablets and desktop computers, so making the MVP a fully responsive web service.</p>

            <div class="single-project-text">
              <h4>Frame Conditions</h4>
							<p>In the context of creating an MVP, one of the major constraints of the project was to design as lean as possible and spent every coin effectively. Thus, the process steps strongly aligned with the suggestions made by Jeff Gothelf in his book „Lean UX“.</p>
              <p>Furthermore every design had to follow a mobile first approach, this making it easier to scale designs up.</p>
              <p>Aside from this, the frame was set rather free and left a comfortable space for design and process decisions.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

              <h4>Approach</h4>
              <div class="img-container"><img src="assets/img/cases/Zalando/case_Zalando_img1.jpg" alt=""></div>
              <p>As one of the first steps, design and product management met and created as set Proto-Persona to display the different types of brands and merchants using the article and order management. In comparison to conventional personas, Proto-Personas still aim to give image to a stereotypical user of service that should be designed, but are not based upon actual research data. They are simply assumptions that should be validated in the steps to follow, e.g. interviews or surveys. Therefore, a temporary display of the customer is available and can be used to design upon.</p>
              <div class="img-container"><img src="assets/img/cases/Zalando/case_Zalando_img2.jpg" alt=""></div>
              <p>Being an essential part of the Lean UX process, the product development team held a Design Studio workshops ahead prototyping and design. This was to make the team create a common design approach for further work in each field of expertise, from UX and UI design, over front end to back end development. Each workshop participant was asked to create six sketches which were then presented to the team. After having received feedback from the colleagues, each team member merged his or her ideas into one sketch and presented it again to the team. Based upon a second feedback round, all ideas were merged into one group sketch. This sketch served as a base ensured a quick validation of the feasibility of the design approach and gave a base for the further and simultaneous work of everyone in the development process.</p>
              <p>Both designs for overarching navigation and article and order management followed the same process steps of paper prototyping, lo-fi and hi-fi prototyping, successively increasing the fidelity. Each of these fidelity phases were followed by user testing to uncover weaknesses in the navigational concept or in the content that was offered by the service. While paper prototypes were tested with in-department colleagues from Brand Solutions, digital prototypes were validated based on feedback from other departments within Zalando who showed similar knowledge and experience backgrounds as the target group.</p>
              <div class="img-container"><img src="assets/img/cases/Zalando/case_Zalando_img3.jpg" alt=""></div>
              <p>Especially, when UI solutions of tricky problems have not been as understandable as assumed, paper prototyping could take some rounds to find the right way of how to design the interface. But in the end, this fail-early method effectively prevented the waste of money by identifying false leading approaches as early as possible.</p>

              <p>In addition to the actual product design, I also helped to work out a pattern library bearing all UI elements needed in the Brand Solutions product family. Being a so-called living style guide, it has been managed and enhanced by my former design colleagues and can be publicly be visited on GitHub.</p>

              <div class="img-container"><img src="assets/img/cases/Zalando/case_Zalando_img6.jpg" alt=""></div>
							<p>The final deliverable was handed over as validated high fidelity prototype created with Sketch and Axure RP. It displayed interaction, visual and transitional design of the use cases of adding and editing articles and completing incoming orders. As required, viewports for smartphones, tablets and desktop computers have been addressed by distinctive responsive breakpoints.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the workshop materials, such as photographs of whiteboard evaluations, flip chart sketches and paper prototypes, have been documented and described for potential future use.</p>
