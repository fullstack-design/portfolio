								<h3>Summary</h3>
								<p>Cornelsen Schulverlage is one of the largest publishers of educational literature in Germany.</p>
                <p>As a part of their product family, “Diagnose & Fördern” was designed and developed to identify learning weaknesses of secondary school students and support them on improving their performances.</p>
                <p>Settled in the context of a classroom, the product had to tackle challenges of slow, unreliable or even no wifi access. This was managed by giving the teachers the possibility to have their students tested at home and print out support material as an offline exit point from the interaction flow.</p>

								<h3>Description</h3>

								<h4>Problem</h4>
								<p>In every class teachers have the same problem: very little time to support the learning of up to 30 students with individual levels of performance, while still upholding the regular curriculum. As a consequence, many teachers choose to teach for an intermediate level of performance, causing weak students not to understand the basic topics and strong students not to exploit their whole potentials.</p>

  					<div class="single-project-text">
              <h4>Task</h4>
							<p>Seen from a structural point of view, the „Diagnose & Fördern“ project was rather conventional. Thus, my task mainly concerned UI design, prototyping and usability testing and alignment with product management. As I continued the work of a preceding designer, features were already defined and my primary mission was to create an understandable interface and to remove weaknesses in the concept as soon they were identified. Nevertheless, I also had the opportunity to implement lean methods to validate design assumptions early and to minimize waste time.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2">
            <div class="single-project-text">
              <h4>Frame Conditions</h4>
							<p>German schools heavily suffer from an under-digitalized infrastructure in buildings and class rooms. A significant number of institutions do not even have access to the internet, an internal network or computers in general. While lacking the hardware and the experience, especially older teachers tend to avoid using digital media to pass on knowledge and skills.</p>
							<p>So, as well the missing access to the internet in the classrooms as also the teachers’ inexperience with digital media, pose difficult constraints for the design and development of solving heterogene learning weaknesses in classes.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2">
            <div class="single-project-text">
              <h4>Approach</h4>
							<p>The basic material that was handed over to me already showed screens, but some major use cases were still missing. As a first step, I restructured the Sketch file, following the principles of Atomic Design and implemented a broad use of symbols and styles.</p>
              <p>After having overlooked briefing and design material, the use cases that have not been designed yet were approached by creating lean paper prototypes. Those were were enhanced by a simplified color scheme of the already existing visual design.</p>
              <div class="img-container"><img src="assets/img/cases/Cornelsen/case_Cornelsen_img1.png" alt=""></div>
              <div class="img-container"><img src="assets/img/cases/Cornelsen/case_Cornelsen_img2.png" alt=""></div>
              <p>As mentioned, the product had to tackle challenges of slow, unreliable or even no wifi access in schools. In the concept, this was solved by giving the teacher the possibility to have his or her students tested at their homes, evaluate their results in home office and print out support material as an offline exit point for the use case  in the classroom.</p>
              <p>The paper prototypes displaying the new use cases were validated in  hallway testings at a Cornelsen selling point for school books, known to be a location where teachers frequently go to get informed about new material. Six present teachers were asked to answer a few questions about their context of work, their needs and pains. The validation of the prototype itself was done by story-telling a fictional situation of use and setting a task that should be completed by using the prototype. During the use the testers explained their actions, their positive and negative emotions and reactions and their thoughts in general towards the interface. Depending on the actions of the tester, I placed new papers for different states, overlays or pages. While I was leading the test, a colleague of mine wrote down the feedback.</p>
              <div class="img-container"><img src="assets/img/cases/Cornelsen/case_Cornelsen_img3.png" alt=""></div>
              <div class="img-container"><img src="assets/img/cases/Cornelsen/case_Cornelsen_img4.png" alt=""></div>
              <p>After all tests had been completed, the post-its were pinned to a whiteboard and finally clustered into groups of approval, disapproval, usability issues and other opportunities for improvements. In the next iteration of the prototype, these insights that were distilled from the testing of the paper prototypes were then implemented into a interactive digital prototype made with Sketch and InVision.</p>
              <div class="img-container"><img src="assets/img/cases/Cornelsen/case_Cornelsen_img5.png" alt=""></div>
              <div class="img-container"><img src="assets/img/cases/Cornelsen/case_Cornelsen_img6.png" alt=""></div>
              <p>Not ultimately related to „Diagnose & Fördern“, I also led a half-day workshop to optimize the design and development framework of the scook platform in general. This Design Studio workshop brought eight people from all relevant fields with valuable input to the subject together, while parity between the different expertise was maintained. Each workshop participant was asked to create six sketches which were then presented to the team. After having received feedback from the colleagues, each team member merged his or her ideas into one sketch and presented it again to the team. Based upon a second feedback round, two teams, each of four participants, again merged the ideas of their single members into one group sketch with multiple steps of interaction. In the end the two solutions were presented to the whole workshop participants and recorded for documentation.</p>
              <p>This schedule was rather tight, leaving only short periods of time to sketch, present and give feedback. But these quick rounds of iterations made it possible to develop a resilient design draft to optimize the communication and implementation within the cook product family in only three hours of workshop.</p>

							<p>The final deliverable has been handed over in form of an InVision prototype that displayed all designs and interactions. Hereafter, the development used this prototype and the related Sketch file to build the actual application „Diagnose & Fördern“.</p>
              <p>The results of the workshop have been described and collected in detailed documentation, being the base for further design decisions.</p>
