								<h3>Summary</h3>
								<p><strong>SoDi</strong> is a non-governmental organization that collects donations to support charity and building projects in developing countries.</p>
                <p>To develop a solution in order to raise income of donations from people in the age of 30 to 50 years, a Design Thinking workshop was held with the client. A team of 6 members went through the steps of understanding the context of the problem, observing the potential users, redefining the design challenge on a promising, likely solvable aspect, generating ideas, developing conceptual prototypes and quickly testing them with people on the street.</p>

								<h4>Problem</h4>
								<p>At the moment of assignment, SoDi was struggling decreasing amounts of donations for their charity projects, due to a generation shift in the target group of supporters and donators. Thus, budget for financing projects became more and more limited.</p>
  						</div>
  					</div>
          </div>

          <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2">
  					<div class="single-project-text">
              <h4>Task</h4>
							<p>To solve this critical issue, SoDi needed to find a way to acquire new donating supporters. Being a quite unusual problem, Design Thinking was chosen as the right method. The workshop was then planned, prepared and led by me as a moderator.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

            <div class="single-project-text">
              <h4>Frame Conditions</h4>
							<p>Although many members of the SoDi team took interest in participating the workshops, budget and time were still very limited. So, the suggestion was to have a lean two-day workshop of Design Thinking.</p>
							<p>The team itself was set set up by 8 SoDi employees, all from different fields such as management, accounting and marketing with varying levels of expertise from intern to managing director. The unusually large team size for such a short workshop would normally create obstacles in communication, but the team showed excellent abilities in communication behavior, being open-minded and perceiving colleagues als equals.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2">
            <div class="single-project-text">
              <h4>Approach</h4>
							<p>As the team had not done Design Thinking before, I chose the six-step model proposed by Hasso Plattner. Its detailed structure gives more guidance in a narrow schedule, such as in this case.</p>

              <h4>Step 1: Understand</h4>

              <div class="img-container"><img src="assets/img/cases/SoDi/case_SoDi_img1.jpg" alt=""></div>
              <p>After starting the first workshop day with a short ice breaker game, the team was asked to write down on post-its everything that came to their minds when reading the team goal</p>
              <p class="quote">„We want to find a way to digitally increase online donations in 2016.“</p>
              <p>The answers were presented and then clustered. Every team member was able to understand the points of view of his or her colleagues and create a shared understanding.</p>

              <h4>Step 2: Observe</h4>
              <div class="img-container"><img src="assets/img/cases/SoDi/case_SoDi_img2.jpg" alt=""></div>
              <p>Due to the short schedule, it was not possible to conduct surveys or hold interviews with representative interested in donating. Thus, based on the team’s experiences in the past and assumptions, they created a proto-persona of a stereotype donator which would then have been validated in the succeeding process.</p>
              <p>The result gave the team a visual impression of the demographics, social background, political opinions, motivations, goals, needs, touchpoint and pain points of the customer group.</p>
              <div class="img-container"><img src="assets/img/cases/SoDi/case_SoDi_img3.jpg" alt=""></div>
              <p>In addition to the proto-persona, the team created a customer journey to evaluate the steps of how</p>

              <ul>
                <li>the customer would grow awareness of donations for SoDi,</li>
                <li>get interested,</li>
                <li>consider the use of the service and</li>
                <li>finally decide to donate and translate this decision to an successful act.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>For each of these steps, the team look at the touchpoint, possible barriers, emotional responses and reactions.</p>

              <h4>Step 3: Define</h4>
              <p>Before generating ideas upon the learnings from preceding phases, the team made sure that the hole team did come to the same level of understanding. Also, the goal of the workshop was narrowed and re-worded in a more precise way:</p>
              <p class="quote">„We want to create trust at young and educated people, by offering a professional website and content in social media, motivating them to donate more and re-share our contents.“</p>
              <p>With this statement, the first workshop day ended.</p>

              <h4>Step 4: Ideate</h4>
              <p>The second workshop day started instantly with generating ideas by using a modified version of method 635. Following this method,  sketching papers have to be folded two times horizontally and four times vertically, creating a grid of three to five cells. Each cell serves as a canvas for sketching one idea. In the following, six participants sketch three ideas on an own paper sheet, filling out the first row. After ten minutes, all papers are handed over to the next team member and everyone continues the ideas of his or her predecessor. This happens five times. With this method, a large amount of ideas can be created in very short time.</p>
              <div class="img-container"><img src="assets/img/cases/SoDi/case_SoDi_img4.jpg" alt=""></div>
              <p>As the team was larger than six members, the method was modified to eight participants. All the rest was kept as proposed.</p>
              <p>After the team had finished sketching ideas, every team member presented the paper sheet he or she worked on in last rotation. In the end the whole team rated the best ideas, by putting three dots to their favorite ideas.</p>
              <p>The two best rated ideas were chosen to be prototyped and tested. </p>

              <h4>Step 5: Prototype</h4>
              <p>To quickly prototype both ideas the team was split into two groups, each one prototyping one idea. Following the principles of Design Thinking, the team was also at this point divided in a way that maintained a multi-disciplinary composition of the prototyping sub-teams.</p>
              <p>As instruments to create prototypes, the teams could use several sorts of tools, including paper, colored pens, pencils, scissors, tape straps and dough. Both groups decided to create paper prototypes with pen and paper.</p>
              <div class="img-container"><img src="assets/img/cases/SoDi/case_SoDi_img5.jpg" alt=""></div>
              <p>After about an hour the teams were asked to present their prototypes to the others and receive feedback. With this, both teams went back to iterate their prototypes, improving the design of their ideas.</p>

              <h4>Step 6: Test</h4>
              <p>Each group having prototyped their idea, the teams were sent out to gather feedback on their designs in so-called hallway testings, also known as guerrilla testings. These were done with passers-by in the surroundings of the workshop site or in nearby cafés with people being invited for a coffee or a cake.</p>
              <p>After each group had received feedback from six testers, the gathered insights were presented to the team, opportunities for improvements or how to merge ideas were discussed and then recorded.</p>
              <p>With this final step, the workshop had ended.</p>

              <h4>Deliverable</h4>
							<p>As a final handover SoDi receive a documentation of every step of the whole workshop, its generated insights, ideas and prototypes. The document also contained suggestions of how to proceed, e.g. the merging of the prototypes to bring the best ideas together.</p>
